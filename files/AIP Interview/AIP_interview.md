# Tips for posdoc interviews

## 3 minutes “elevator pitch”
 
>During my internship at the National Laboratory of Astrophysics (LNA), I developed a method to characterize CCD cameras used in the OPD observatory. This involved experiments to determine key performance metrics like read noise, dark noise, electronic gain, and quantum efficiency (QE). One of our experiments uncovered an unexpected spatial distribution in the dark current of one camera, likely tied to its fabrication process.
Building on this during my master’s at UNIFEI, I developed an optimization method for the scientific cameras of SPARC4, using Bayesian Optimization. This method significantly improved camera efficiency, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio and acquisition rate. When applied in real observations, it showed up to 97% improvement in camera performance.
Currently, in my PhD at INPE, I’m focused on developing the Artificial Image Simulator (AIS) for SPARC4. This Python-based software simulates photometric and polarimetric images, helping us model how SPARC4 interacts with observed light. We are working to calibrate this model against real observations and aim to characterize SPARC4’s polarimetric response to match it to the SDSS system.
Additionally, I participated in an exchange program at Liverpool John Moores University, where I worked on data acquisition with the MOPTOP instrument. We characterized its polarimetric response and applied it to analyze the polarization of Gamma-Ray Burst 230818A.
Throughout my academic journey, I developed the SPARC4 Camera Control System (S4CCS), which integrates LabVIEW, Python, and an SDK from Oxford Instruments to control SPARC4’s cameras. This system supports rapid imaging with minimal overhead, facilitating efficient data collection for scientific observations.

## Perguntas do ESO fellowship

**What do you think are the biggest achievements in Astronomy/AIP in the last 5/10 years?**
> .

**Where do you think new instrumentation/telescopes will take your research field? Or: which future instrument will impact your research the most? How?**
> . 

**What do you think will be the biggest impact of new instrumentation/telescopes onto Astronomy in general?**
>.

**How would you describe your research to somebody that does know anything about Astronomy (your grandmother)**
> I would describe my work as supporting astronomers in their study of the sky by developing astronomical instrumentation. The primary tool of an astronomer is the telescope, which allows for much greater sensitivity than the human eye. However, a wide range of studies can be conducted by attaching additional instruments to the telescope. For instance, we can transform the light from a star into a spectrum, akin to a rainbow. I am responsible for developing the control systems for these types of instruments, enabling their precise operation and enhancing the scope of astronomical research.

**Have you ever encountered a conflict situation during your work? If so, how did you resolve it?**
> There was an instance where my supervisor assigned me a task that I was certain was incorrect. In that situation, I took a moment to compose myself and proceeded with the task as requested. Ultimately, my supervisor recognized the error and was convinced of the issue.

**Suppose a visiting astronomer comes to Paranal and weather conditions don't allow to open the telescope. They blame you. How do you react?**
> I would explain that, unfortunately, opening the telescope under the current conditions poses a risk to the observatory's equipment. Therefore, I am not permitted to allow the observation to proceed at this time. However, I would also mention that if the individual remains patient, there is a possibility that the weather conditions may improve later in the night, potentially allowing us to open the telescope.

**What do you expect to be the biggest challenge of a fellowship in AIP?**
> The biggest challenge will be, in a first sight, to undertand how to use the equipment related to my work. Getting used to the workstations, as well as how to properly deal with the cameras to get the result that I need is a task that requires a learning curve. I belive that, after this first impression, I will be able to accomplish the objectives of my fellowship without worries.

**Not so much a question: but be prepared for some instrument related questions if there is an obvious instrument for your research topic**
> .

**Assume you are offered a fellowship and after a year of work you realise you are not on track with your scientific work. How would you try and solve that problem?**
> If I found myself in a situation where, after a year, I realized I was not on track with my scientific work during a fellowship, I would approach the issue in a structured manner:
> First, I would assess the situation by identifying the specific reasons for the delay—whether they are related to unforeseen challenges in the research, time management, or other external factors. Next, I would consult with my supervisor or mentor, seeking their advice and feedback on how to adjust my approach to meet the expected goals. I believe open communication is essential in such situations to realign expectations and seek guidance on prioritizing tasks.
> Additionally, I would revise my work plan, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable milestones to create a clear path forward. This would allow me to focus on the most critical tasks and monitor progress more closely. If necessary, I would explore resources or collaborations that could accelerate my work, whether through technical support, additional training, or partnerships.

**Why should we hire you?**
> You should consider hiring me because I possess a skill set that is well-suited to addressing the challenges associated with this fellowship. As you may be aware, our objective is the characterization of the PAWS camera. I have been working with CCD cameras for eight years, and my first published article focused on the characterization of the SPARC4 cameras. With this experience, combined with my expertise in software development, I am confident in my ability to establish a robust methodology for the systematic characterization of camera performance. Additionally, I will ensure that a comprehensive record of the results obtained throughout the duration of the fellowship is maintained.


**If you were offered the job, would you accept it? How long would it take for you to decide?**
> I am very enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your team, and I would certainly be inclined to accept the job if offered. However, I would take a moment to carefully review the details of the offer to ensure that I fully understand the terms and responsibilities. I believe that a period of two to three days would be sufficient for me to make an informed decision. Ultimately, I want to ensure that I am fully committed to the role and aligned with the organization's goals.

**They also asked some specific questions about some things that I wrote on my science proposal**
