The primary goal of the EHT is to directly observe the **event horizon** of black holes, which is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape due to the immense gravitational pull.

### Key Features of the Event Horizon Telescope:

1. **Global Array of Telescopes:**
   The EHT is not a single telescope but rather a global network of radio telescopes that work together through a technique called **very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)**. By synchronizing the observations of multiple telescopes located at various points on Earth, the EHT effectively creates a telescope the size of our planet, providing extremely high-resolution images.

   - Telescopes contributing to the EHT are located in diverse locations, such as:
     - North America (e.g., ALMA in Chile, the Submillimeter Array in Hawaii)
     - Europe (e.g., IRAM in Spain)
     - Antarctica (e.g., the South Pole Telescope)
     - Asia (e.g., James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii)
     - Africa and other parts of the world.
   
   - The wide geographical distribution of these observatories allows for capturing detailed images of compact objects like black holes, despite their vast distances from Earth.

2. **Imaging the Event Horizon:**
   The EHT is designed to observe **supermassive black holes** at the center of galaxies. It operates in the **millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths**, which are capable of penetrating the dense gas and dust surrounding black holes, allowing for detailed observation of the region near the event horizon.

   - The two primary targets of the EHT are:
     - **Sagittarius A\* (Sgr A\*)**, the supermassive black hole at the center of the **Milky Way**, which is located about 26,000 light-years from Earth and has a mass around 4 million times that of the Sun.
     - **M87\* (Messier 87\*)**, the supermassive black hole at the center of the **Messier 87 galaxy**, located about 53.5 million light-years away and with a mass of roughly 6.5 billion solar masses.

3. **First Image of a Black Hole:**
   In **April 2019**, the EHT collaboration released the **first-ever image of a black hole**, capturing the silhouette of M87\*'s event horizon. This image showed a bright ring of emission surrounding a dark region, which represents the shadow of the black hole. The observation confirmed predictions made by **Einstein's General Theory of Relativity**, as the image closely matched simulations of black holes based on theoretical models.

   - This was a groundbreaking moment in astrophysics, marking the first direct visual evidence of a black hole's event horizon.
   - The bright ring of light is caused by hot plasma swirling around the black hole, with gravitational lensing bending the light into a circular shape.

4. **Data Collection and Processing:**
   Due to the vast distances and the need for extremely high precision, the data collected by the EHT observatories are enormous. Each telescope records data on hard drives, which are then flown to central processing facilities where the data are combined and analyzed.

   - The **VLBI technique** allows the signals from all the telescopes to be combined, effectively synchronizing them to create a single, incredibly powerful telescope. This process requires atomic clocks to ensure the observations from different parts of the world are perfectly aligned in time.
   - The EHT uses **supercomputers** to process the petabytes of data collected, reconstructing the image of the black hole from the interferometric signals.

5. **Key Science Goals:**
   The EHT project is aimed at several key scientific objectives:
   - **Probing the nature of black holes:** By imaging the event horizon, the EHT allows scientists to test Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity under extreme gravitational conditions.
   - **Understanding the physics of accretion and jets:** Black holes are often surrounded by disks of hot gas and can eject powerful relativistic jets. Observing these regions close to the event horizon helps scientists understand how these processes work.
   - **Studying black hole shadows and spacetime curvature:** The "shadow" cast by the black hole's event horizon provides information about spacetime curvature, allowing scientists to test fundamental physics near black holes.

6. **Future Developments:**
   After the success of the 2019 image, the EHT collaboration is working on refining its techniques and expanding its network of telescopes to achieve even higher resolution images and to observe new targets. Key goals for the future include:
   - **More detailed imaging of M87\* and Sgr A\*:** By adding more telescopes to the array and improving data collection techniques, future observations will provide clearer images and potentially even video sequences of material orbiting black holes.
   - **Polarization data:** Recent results (2021) have provided polarized images of M87\*, giving insights into the magnetic fields around the black hole and how they contribute to the formation of jets.
   - **Studying other black holes:** In addition to Sgr A\* and M87\*, the EHT may be able to target other black holes, including those in nearby galaxies.

### Scientific Impact of the EHT:

1. **Confirming Theories of Relativity:**
   The EHT’s first image of a black hole provided a major test of **Einstein's General Theory of Relativity** in a strong gravitational field. The observed structure of the black hole's shadow and the bright ring closely matched predictions, offering strong evidence in favor of the theory.

2. **Understanding Black Hole Physics:**
   The EHT provides direct observations of the environment near a black hole's event horizon, offering insights into the behavior of matter and energy under extreme gravitational forces. This helps address long-standing questions about how black holes grow, how they interact with their surroundings, and how relativistic jets are launched.

3. **Cosmology and Astrophysics:**
