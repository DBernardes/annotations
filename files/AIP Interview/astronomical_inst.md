# The cutting-edge of the astronomical instrumentation

## James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)

The **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)** is the most advanced space telescope ever built, launched in December 2021 by NASA, in partnership with the ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). It is designed to observe the universe primarily in **infrared**, allowing it to explore obscured regions of space, such as stellar dust clouds, and observe very distant objects, like the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang.

### Main Features:
- **Infrared observation capability**: The JWST can see through cosmic dust and capture detailed images of forming stars and planets, as well as study the composition of exoplanet atmospheres.
- **Giant primary mirror**: With a diameter of 6.5 meters, its segmented mirror allows for much higher resolution than the Hubble, making it ideal for studying the early universe and galaxy formation processes.
- **Advanced scientific instruments**: These include **NIRCam** (Near-Infrared Camera) and **MIRI** (Mid-Infrared Instrument), which enable the study of both distant objects and nearby details, such as planetary systems and stars.

### Missions and Objectives:
- **Study of the primordial universe**: Observing the first galaxies formed more than 13 billion years ago, allowing us to understand cosmic evolution.
- **Star and planet formation**: By observing dust disks around stars, JWST will help us understand how planetary systems form.
- **Exoplanets and habitability**: The telescope has the capability to study the atmospheres of planets outside the Solar System, searching for signs of water, methane, and other molecules that might indicate conditions suitable for life.

The JWST is expected to revolutionize astrophysics and cosmology, replacing the Hubble in many aspects and ushering in a new era of discoveries in the study of the cosmos.
